st.write("""MAVISp includes different types of predictions for the effect of mutations
on protein function, structure or more. Its final goal is to predict the effect of
relevant variants of unknown significance and identify their mechanism of action.

MAVISp has been designed by the Cancer Structural Biology (Danish Cancer Institute, Denmark)
and the Cancer Systems Biology (Department of Health and Technology at the Technical University of Demark)
groups, headed by Dr. Elena Papaleo
