We are organizing the first MAVISp BioCurator Training Workshop! 

During the event, you will learn the basics behind the MAVISp methodology and work towards becoming a curator for the MAVISp server and website, on your own proteins of interest. The program includes:
An overview of the methodological framework behind MAVISp
Hands on sessions, to learn how to use the tools supported by MAVISp to curate your own protein of choice
Access to a computing server to perform the analyses

The methodology you will learn can be used to generate data for novel proteins to be added to the MAVISp dataset, as well as standalone for your own research.
