st.markdown("""Following a benchmarking effort that we recently did to improve the prediction performance of the LONG_RANGE module, we have devised a new and improved LONG_RANGE workflow to be used for new MAVISp entries. At the time being, the MAVISp database contains both entries done using this new protocol as well as entries made using the previous one. Which of them was used for any entry can be discerned in the main proteins table of the MAVISp website, as the new workflow uses simple interatomics contacts for filtering, while the older one used inter-carbon alpha distances. For more details about the new protocol see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ELELAB/MAVISp_allosigma2_workflow/), and you'll be able to read all the relevant details in our soon to be published paper.""")
